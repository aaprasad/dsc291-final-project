## Log-Euclidean Signatures for Intrinsic Distances Between Unaligned Datasets

Python implementation of the LES distance and examples from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01671). LES is an
intrinsic geometric measure for comparing unaligned datasets of different dimensions and domains.

## Prerequisites

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org/install/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)
- Optional packages for clustered data usage example: [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
- Optional packages and repositories for comparisons with other algorithms:
    - [IMD](https://github.com/xgfs/imd) [1] - clone and place the `msid` folder in the current folder.
    - TDA: H0, H1 and H2 bottleneck distances, requires [persim](https://pypi.org/project/persim/)
      , [ripser](https://pypi.org/project/ripser/).
    - [GS](https://github.com/KhrulkovV/geometry-score) [2] - clone and place the `gs` folder in the current folder.\
      Requires [GUDHI](https://gudhi.inria.fr/python/latest/installation.html)
      and [Cython](https://pypi.org/project/Cython/).
    - GW [3] - requires [pot](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/plot_Intro_OT.html).

The code was tested with python 3.8 and 3.9

## Usage example of LES

### Distances between multi-cluster and single-cluster datasets of different dimensions

```python
import numpy as np
import sklearn.datasets as skld
from les.les import les_desc_comp, les_dist_comp
   
np.random.seed(1)
x1 = skld.make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=5, n_features=10)[0]
x2 = skld.make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=5, n_features=9)[0]
x3 = skld.make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=1, n_features=10)[0]
  
SIGMA, NEV, GAMMA = 2, 200, 1e-8     
les_desc_x1 = les_desc_comp(x1, SIGMA, NEV, GAMMA)
les_desc_x2 = les_desc_comp(x2, SIGMA, NEV, GAMMA)
les_desc_x3 = les_desc_comp(x3, SIGMA, NEV, GAMMA)
    
print('LES(x1{5 clusters}, x2{5 clusters})=',les_dist_comp(les_desc_x1, les_desc_x2))
print('LES(x1{5 clusters}, x3{1 cluster})=',les_dist_comp(les_desc_x1, les_desc_x3))
print('LES(x2{5 clusters}, x3{1 cluster})=',les_dist_comp(les_desc_x2, les_desc_x3))
```

### Running the tori example (Figure 1 in the paper)

```bash
python les/main_tori.py
```

By default the code compares LES only with our implementation of IMD (our approach) to reduce run-time and code
dependencies. To compare with additional algorithms that were mentioned in the paper, specify the algorithm names in `main_tori.py`, `ALGS2COMPARE`, and follow
the installation instructions of each package in the prequisites above.
Note that the topological data analysis methods (tda) and Gromov-Wasserstein distance (gw) require significantly longer
run-times.
